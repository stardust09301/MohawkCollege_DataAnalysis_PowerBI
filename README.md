# MohawkCollege_DataAnalysis_PowerBI
This work is from Data Systems & Visualization for
Manufacturing Course at Mohawk College in 2023.
In this course, I prepared and analyzed manufacturing information of a business
to generate reports and dashboards using best practices in data visualization for data
analytics within the context of the manufacturing sector through a practical and a 
handson introduction into key tools (MS Excel, MS Power Query and MS Power BI) used to
support real-world business decision making within manufacturing organisations.
